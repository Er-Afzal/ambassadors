Completing the monthly survey is essential for a few reasons. Firstly, it enables me to recognize and showcase your valuable contributions through Twitter shoutouts and other avenues throughout the year. 
Additionally, it helps me keep track of your current activities and ensures I can provide any necessary support if you need assistance.

If you anticipate being temporarily inactive for any reason, please let me know, and I can note your ambassadorship as "on hold" accordingly.

Please remember that consistent engagement in the ambassador program is vital. 
If I receive three consecutive "N/A" responses or fail to receive any communication from you, we will need to schedule a discussion about your continued involvement in the program. 
However, I am confident that we can work together to ensure your ongoing success as an ambassador.

If you have any questions, or concerns or need any assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
Your dedication and contributions are highly valued, and I'm here to support you in any way I can.

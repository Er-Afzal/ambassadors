# Contributing Guidelines

1. Articles should be published within the last ~1 week.
2. Content does not have to be vendor neutral. Put on your community hat and ask - is the article of interest to the community?
3. Highlight open source news, not commercial announcements from a single company.
4. No gated content, unless in the webinar section.
5. Blog posts and videos are the preferred medium.

# Ambassador Emeritus
For those who need to step down from a more active commitment, the emeritus program is being introduced in September 2019.

## Benefits:
You'll still be listed as an ambassador emeritus on the CNCF page and are entitled to attend Ambassador meetings, and remain in the current communication channels.

## Responsibilities:

* Give a talk, host a meetup or perform an activity that spreads the awareness of cloud native twice a year (we're open to suggestions for what works best for you!)
* Report back on your activities for our end-of-year report

If you decide to become more active again, Ambassador Emeritus are always welcome to be reinstated as full CNCF Ambassadors.

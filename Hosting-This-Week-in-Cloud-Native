This Week in Cloud Native is the CNCF weekly live stream for people to learn hands on about CNCF projects and members. The real world is rarely like a “how to” blog post where everything is greenfield and works out of the box. This Week in Cloud Native allows the cloud native community to dig into these problems in real time and see how people solve them. It creates a community around solving cloud native problems and bring our greatest assets, the people, to the fore.

CNCF Ambassadors have the opportunity to become hosts of This Week in Cloud Native to learn with the community and grow their personal brand. Every quarter 2 CNCF Ambassadors will be chosen to be the hosts of This Week in Cloud Native. They will alternate each week who the host will be.

This Week in Cloud Native will stream across [CNCF Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cloudnativefdn), Youtube Live, Periscope, and LinkedIn. In addition to the chat functionality on each platform, there is a [channel in CNCF slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01KEKUJ55Y) where audience members can ask questions before, during, and after the show to engage more with the presenters.

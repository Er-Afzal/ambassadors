## Meetup Best Practices

This page allows you to start a new meetup group based on the experience of existing ones. <br>
Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:
<br>
<br>
* **Create the meetup**

If you start a brand new meetup that aims to cover the whole Cloud Native landscape, we recommend to use the following **naming** convention: <br>
`Cloud Native Computing <Location>`

The **description** of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers. <br>
A brief description of the role of the CNCF and the Cloud Native approach could be added. <br>
Here is an example based on the [FAQ](https://www.cncf.io/about/faq/)

```
Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to be:
1 - Containerized. Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.
2 - Dynamically orchestrated. Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.
3 - Microservices oriented. Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.
```

In order for your meetup to be the most visible you should add a relevant list of **tags**. <br>
(e.g. Cloud Computing · DevOps · Native Cloud Computing · Docking · Microservices · Kubernetes · Cloud Native · Delivery ...)

The most important thing is to keep an **active group**, with frequent events (ideally once a month). <br>
Animating a group alone can be difficult to manage, if that's possible you would be a team composed of passionate co-organizers.
Joining forces helps spreading the load and expands the network.
<br>
<br>
* **Find Speakers**

You should provided some kind of **form** in order to allow people to submit their talk proposal as follows :

_**Note**_: Do a copy ! Please do not edit the form in place.

When possible take care to review their presentations.

Attend **conferences** (e.g. DockerCon, CloudNativeCon...) can help finding speakers, you can meet a lot of people who use or are involved in the cncf projects
<br>
<br>
* **Find sponsors/place**

You should contact local tech companies. Most of them are interested in hosting such kind of events. <br>
It is better to find a place in a central location. Downtown would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of attendees.
<br>
<br>
* **Schedule a new event**

First of all don't forget to thank your sponsors. <br>
Then the most important information is about the agenda, each talk description would contains:

    - A short bio of the speaker
    - An attractive title
    - A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo

If you're planning hands on, you should ensure that the wifi can handle the number of attendees.
Furthermore you should check you're not limited by some kind of quotas (Cloud provider).

The choice of date and time matters. Most of meetups choose Tuesdays or Thursdays after work.
<br>
<br>
* **Booking**

If you're limited by the room capacity, you should do an **overbooking**. <br>
Most of the time there are 30% of people who book but they never come.

You must think about sending a **reminder** message to the meetup group to ask the people to free their place if they can't come.
<br>
<br>
* **Post event**

If possible you would record videos of the presentations to share them afterwards.
At least you would **share** the slides to all members.
<br>
<br>
* **CNCF swags**
_Policy to be defined by the CNCF_
<br>
<br>

* **Ask for help**


If you have any other question you can talk to the **ambassadors** in the [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/).

Cloud Native Live is the CNCF weekly live stream for people to learn hands on about CNCF projects and members. The real world is rarely like a “how to” blog post where everything is greenfield and works out of the box. Cloud Native Live allows the cloud native community to dig into these problems in real time and see how people solve them. It creates a community around solving cloud native problems and bring our greatest assets, the people, to the fore.

CNCF Ambassadors have the opportunity to become hosts of Cloud Native Live to learn with the community and grow their personal brand. Every quarter 2 CNCF Ambassadors will be the hosts of Cloud Native Live, one from the previous quarter and one new one to share experience. They will alternate each week who the host will be.

Cloud Native Live will stream on [CNCF Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cloudnativefdn). In addition to the chat functionality on each platform, there is a [channel in CNCF slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01QS32H170) where audience members can ask questions before, during, and after the show to engage more with the presenters.
